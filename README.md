# Platty-Game
A short platformer game that i made for a school project
I made this game as a challenge for myself to make a working game in 48 hours...

it's not amazing but for the very first project that i did by myself im happy with it :))

to download the game you can clone the whole repo and play the platfformer game.exe..

no python or anything else needed
